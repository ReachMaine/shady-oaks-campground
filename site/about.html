			    <section class="sectiontitle">Our Story</section><p align="left">We are very

			proud of Shady Oaks Campground and thought you might enjoy a bit of

			its' history. In 1969 two couples formed a partnership and purchased

			a piece of land that developed into a 25 site campground designed

			for tents and pop-ups under the name of Kozy Kampers Campground.</p>

			<p align="left">

				<img border="0" src="images/engineer.jpg" width="320" height="500" align="right">The

			campground changed ownership 3 times. Joyce and Don Nelson appeared

			on the scene in 1989 and Shady Oaks was born. That change was a big

			challenge since neither of them had ever experienced the camping

			adventure. Soon it was evident that major changes had to be made to

			keep up with the fast-growing RV industry. A few items on the list

			were a home for the owners, a swimming pool, an updated power

			system, sewer hookups, and renovations to the bathhouse, laundry and

			recreation hall. Most days Don had a chainsaw in one hand and a

			shovel in the other. Joyce was close behind with a mop and broom.</p>

			<p align="left">They learned early on that they needed to create a family

			atmosphere. They encouraged seasonal campers to make Shady Oaks

			their summer home. Young and old alike brought life to the summer

			festivities and friendships grew. After 25 years Shady Oaks has

			grown to 70 sites and 5 cabins. At least half our campers are full

			time summer residents, providing that family atmosphere they sought.</p>

			<p align="left">In October of 2014 Don and Joyce purchased a home and have now

			retired to Island Life and the Greenlaw family moved in.</p>

			<center>

			<p align="left">David and I (Marlene) have camped for many years. First tenting

			then to a travel trailer, then to a pop-up. David and I have always

			dreamed of owning our own campground and used to discuss it as we

			sat by our campfire at the many campgrounds we had visited through

			the years. Our first vacation with our 1 month old daughter Bethany

			was tenting Greenlaw style. Yes we had a tent, but along with that

			came cots, a crib, refrigerator, wooden rocking chair, microwave and

			many other comforts of home. I think that's when David decided that

			we needed a travel trailer. Of course we went all out and bought a

			30 foot camper. </p>

			<center>

			<p align="left">Our favorite part of camping is enjoying our family time around

			the camp fire and the great friends we met along the way. In the

			summer of 2014 our whole family became campers at Shady Oaks and

			fell in love with the Nelsons and all the other families at Shady

			Oaks Campground. We turned a one month stay into what we hope is a

			lifetime.</p>

			<center>

			<p align="left"><img align="left" src="images/around-fire.jpg" width="375" height="219">Come enjoy a relaxing stay with us at Shady Oaks and meet our

			family and our extended family (our campers). Make sure to come to

			one of our amazing pancake breakfasts or a pot luck supper or

			brunch. Sit a spell in one of the rockers on the front porch, listen

			to a story or two, or take a swim in the pool. Take a few days to

			enjoy the great places you can visit just minutes from our doorstep,

			Acadia National Park, Camden-Rockland, Bangor and many other

			destinations in our great state. But whatever you choose to do make

			sure you relax and enjoy your stay with us. We hope to make your

			stay with us very enjoyable and relaxing.</p>
